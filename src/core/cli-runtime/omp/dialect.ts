 * `isTerminal: false` says an async task is still driving this turn forward,
 * anything else (including the field being absent) ends it.
 *
 * omp also answers a prompt it never handed to the agent with a
 * `prompt_result` frame carrying `agentInvoked: false`. That is the end of
 * the turn just as surely — no agent event will follow it — so it settles
 * here too. `agentInvoked: true` only announces that the agent is now
 * running, and settles nothing.
 *
 * Neither rule may be applied to pi: pi's `agent_end` has no `isTerminal`
 * field and can legitimately repeat after a retry or a compaction, so
 * treating it as terminal would end pi's turns early.
