/**
 * The trust tier of a single programmatic agent run: what this run may touch,
 * stated once for every caller that is not a chat surface.
 *
 * This is the shared vocabulary behind two entry points that look unrelated
 * but resolve to the same grant:
 *
 *   - Host-internal callers pass `capability` to
 *     `AgentRunApi.run` / `.stream` (`agent-api.ts`).
 *   - Modules pass `capability` to `host.agent.stream`, whose Host API type
 *     `YoloModuleAgentCapabilityV1` is an alias of this union so the published
 *     contract keeps its versioned name without becoming a second vocabulary.
 *
 * Chat surfaces do *not* use this type: a chat mode is a product identity
 * (persona, environment prompt, context policy, module binding) that *has* a
 * trust tier rather than *being* one, so it resolves through
 * `resolveChatModeRuntime` instead.
